## :bulb: Motivation and Context
Currently, I'm following Android Program from google called "Bangkit". I felt that its not easy, and
takes more time to build app in android native, because i've tried flutter. Then, i saw jetpack compose
from youtube, it was really great improvement from google.

I'm really excited about jetpack compose, i've tried and pushed myself to try jetpack from yesterday.
It has really great to try it, what i like the most is we don't need XML. i just need Composable function
to create UI.

I'm lucky enough join this challenge, and looking forward to push myself and try the next challenge :).
